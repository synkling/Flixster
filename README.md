- [X] (10pts) User can view a list of movies (title, poster image, and overview) currently playing in theaters from the Movie Database API.

   - [X] (1pt) In landscape mode, the rotated alternate layout should use the backdrop image instead and show the title and movie overview to the right of it.

- [ ] (2pts) Improved the user interface by experimenting with styling and coloring.
- [ ] (2pts) For popular movies (i.e. a movie voted for more than 5 stars), the full backdrop image is displayed. Otherwise, a poster image, the movie title, and overview is listed. Use Heterogenous RecyclerViews and use different ViewHolder layout files for popular movies and less popular ones.

### Notes
The newest Android Studio, 4.1.2, enabled a new feature that allows you to use the emulator in the IDE. 
This is great, until you rotate it and it decides to be upside-down.
When you try to use the emulator stand-alone, how most are used to it, the emulator freezes.
I feel like the new feature was more of cover-up for a bug.
I cannot show the bonuses for landscape/portrait as a result, but c'est la vie.
